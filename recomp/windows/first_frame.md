# Native Windows first-frame status

The target is the original game running as a standalone Windows x86_64
executable. A presented game image and working gameplay remain unverified.

The first display-enabled build is `work/windows-first-frame-attempt1`,
host commit `e48ee60b1e920c9079fa744bddce851a39121a24`. It includes the
Windows display adapter, explicit AOSP unknown-manufacturer profile, JNI
instance long returns, and opt-in EGL/GL diagnostics and PNG capture.
The native build and focused component checks pass. Its actual muted
collector startup exits with access violation C0000005 before EGL or GL;
no image or successful presentation was recorded.

One debugger execution of that exact executable, preserved under
`work/first-frame-native-av-debug1`, identifies the failure. The original
refresh-rate wrapper `70acc13c` calls `Display.getRefreshRate()F` through
JNI slot56. It receives the actual Windows refresh rate120.0f. Original
instruction `70abccbc` (`1e281c08`, `FCSEL S8,S0,S8,NE`) selects float bits
without accessing memory. The retained generated body instead performs
`select -> inttoptr -> load i32`. It dereferences the selected120.0f bits,
`42f00000`, and faults. The frozen native fault is
`sub_70acc13c+4020`; the captured module base and native instruction agree.
This diagnoses a retained legacy FCSEL translation, not a JNI object or
long-return mismatch.

The repair reuses the already qualified FCSEL translator documented in
[fcsel.md](../whole/fcsel.md), regenerates the complete original refresh
wrapper, and replaces that body in Unity shard459. Other definitions,
guest inputs, State layout, host providers and lifecycle behavior must
remain unchanged. A focused check must cover the exact instruction with
120.0f/zero inputs and both selection outcomes before another original
startup is run. Passing that check alone does not prove game rendering.

First-frame acceptance requires an image captured from the original GL
window framebuffer, original drawing activity, a successful original
`eglSwapBuffers`, and a returned original `nativeRender`. A synthetic
triangle or clear-only surface is not evidence of a game frame. The
`--first-frame` diagnostic preserves the image and holds the real window
for ten seconds when its witness succeeds. Audio stays explicitly muted
while the HDMI endpoint is unavailable.
